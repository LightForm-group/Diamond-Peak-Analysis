abstract = {The effect of preheat temperature and inter-pass reheating on microstructure and texture evolution during unidirectional hot rolling of Ti-6Al-4V in the alpha + beta field was investigated. Three different heating schedules were used to roll plates at 10{\%} reduction per pass to a 3:1 total reduction (true strain = 1.15): (1) preheat at 955 °C with inter-pass reheating for 3 min, (2) preheat at 955 °C without inter-pass reheating, and (3) preheat at 815 °C with inter-pass reheating for 3 min. Following rolling, each plate was air cooled to simulate production practice. The microstructures and textures were determined using electron-backscatter and X-ray diffraction techniques. The results revealed that the intensity of basal poles decreased along the rolling direction and increased along the normal and transverse directions with decreasing rolling (furnace) temperature or the elimination of reheating between passes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Stark2015,
abstract = {Intermetallic $\gamma$-TiAl based alloys exhibit excellent high-temperature strength combined with low density. This makes them ideal candidates for replacing the twice as dense Ni base super-alloys, currently used in the medium temperature range ({\~{}}700 °C) of industrial and aviation gas turbines. An important step towards the serial production of TiAl parts is the development of suitable hot-forming processes. Thermo-mechanical treatments often result in mechanical anisotropy due to the formation of crystallographic textures. However, with conventional texture analysis techniques, their formation can only be studied after processing. In this study, in situ high-energy X-ray diffraction measurements with synchrotron radiation were performed during hot-forming. Thus, it was possible to record the evolution of the phase constitution as well as the formation of crystallographic texture of different phases directly during processing. Several process temperatures (1100 °C to 1300 °C) and deformation rates were investigated. Based on these experiments, a process window can be recommended which results in the formation of an optimal reduced texture.},

@article{Canelo-Yubero2016,
abstract = {Two Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn alloys, with globular and lamellar microstructures, are deformed at 750 ??C during tensile and compression tests. The lamellar microstructure shows softening and higher peak stress values than the globular microstructure as a consequence of the Hall-Petch effect. In-situ high energy synchrotron diffraction experiments allow characterization of the load partition between ??- and ??-phases, plastic deformation mechanisms and texture evolution. The ??-phase deforms mainly by rotation while the ??-phase deforms by misorientation formation, acting merely as load transfer agent. The Taylor factor evolution of the ??-phase and the annihilation of dislocations are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The Taylor factor is connected to both the softening observed in the alloy with the lamellar microstructure and the texture development.},

abstract = "Microstructure-based constitutive models for multiphase steels require accurate constitutive properties of the individual phases for component forming and performance simulations. We address this requirement with a combined experimental/theoretical methodology which determines the critical resolved shear stresses and hardening parameters of the constituent phases in QP980, a TRIP assisted steel subject to a two-step quenching and partitioning heat treatment. High energy X-Ray diffraction (HEXRD) from a synchrotron source provided the average lattice strains of the ferrite, martensite, and austenite phases from the measured volume during in situ tensile deformation. The HEXRD data was then input to a computationally efficient, elastic-plastic self-consistent (EPSC) crystal plasticity model which estimated the constitutive parameters of different slip systems for the three phases via a trial-and-error approach. The EPSC-estimated parameters are then input to a finite element crystal plasticity (CPFE) model representing the QP980 tensile sample. The predicted lattice strains and global stress versus strain curves are found to be 8% lower that the EPSC model predicted values and from the HEXRD measurements, respectively. This discrepancy, which is attributed to the stiff secant assumption in the EPSC formulation, is resolved with a second step in which CPFE is used to iteratively refine the EPSC-estimated parameters. Remarkably close agreement is obtained between the theoretically-predicted and experimentally derived flow curve for the QP980 material."

@article{Hammersley1996,
abstract = {Detector systems introduce distortions into acquired data. To obtain accurate angle and intensity information, it is necessary to calibrate, and apply corrections. Intensity non-linearity, spatial distortion, and non-uniformity of intensity response, are the primary considerations. It is better to account for the distortions within scientific analysis software, but often it is more practical to correct the distortions to produce 'idealised' data. Calibration methods and software have been developed for single crystal diffraction experiments, using both approaches. For powder diffraction experiments the additional task of converting a two-dimensional image to a one-dimensional spectrum is used to allow Rietveld analysis. This task may be combined with distortion correction to produce intensity information and error estimates. High-pressure experiments can introduce additional complications and place new demands on software. Flexibility is needed to be able to integrate different angular regions separately, and to produce profiles as a function of angle of azimuth. Methods to cope with awkward data are described, and examples of the techniques applied to data from high pressure experiments are presented.},
