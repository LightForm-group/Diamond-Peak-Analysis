#Radial averaging

This has 36 cakes but this is not constant - may have more or less. Can read this in from the file.
The angle of the first cake in the file is not defined. This may be chosen by the user.
This means that the concept of "up" is relative to the angle that the user set.
* Add a parameter for the angle of the first cake.
However, angles are always distributed equally throught the two pi and so can assume each cake has a constant angle difference to the previous.

Single file averaging options
top = 3 top cakes
bottom = bottom 3 cakes
left, right = left/right 3 cakes
vertical = top + bottom (6 cakes total)
horizontal = left + right (6 total)

Two options for averaging
* can either add together intensities to form a single spectrum **merge_intensity**(kind of OK)
* or just plot all cakes on one graph and do a fit to this **merge_points**.

# Time peak monitoring
* Experimental metadata object to sotre frame time, num cakes, .cake angle etc.
Over time the experimental parameters change and so the peaks change, the peaks change in both intensity and position.
The intensity varies quite a lot (need many averages) and so this is less easy to measure than the changin peak position.
We want to monitor the changing intensity and position of the peaks.
Some peaks may appear from the noise, others may disappear into the noise - not all peaks appear at all times.
Can keep track of the peaks, becuase they dont move much between each timestep - 
run_thru_images shifts the peak position in each sequential step so that peaks are not lost but can still use narrow bounds for peak position.

# Storage of fits
Once the fits are done it is desirable to store them. Want to store the fits as well as the derived data.
Can publish fits!

# Mapping fits to mechanical data
This is more data from a separate file, things like load, temperature.
Some data (true-stress, true-strain) comes at a different sample rate and may start at a slightly different time.

# Auto peak fitting
scipy.fit_peaks.
