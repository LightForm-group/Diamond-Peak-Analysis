    "The experiment begins at room temperature, heats for approximately 200 seconds, is held at constant temperature for about 100 seconds. The material being analysed then undergoes a mechanical deformation for approximately 10 seconds around 340 seconds from the start of the experiment. After this is sample is then cooled back to room temperature. We expect the crystal structure of the material to be primarily hexagonal ($\\alpha$-phase) at room temperature, primarily BCC ($\\beta$-phase) and high temperature and we expect some structural change as a result of the deformation.\n",
